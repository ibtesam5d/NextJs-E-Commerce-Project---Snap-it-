# Introduction

Snap-it is a full-stack e-commerce application created with Next js. This full stack project showcases my strong understanding on creating dynamic front-end components using back-end data.

# Project's Goal

Aim for this project was to build a real-world fully functioning (except getting the actual product) online store that welcomes with a hero section, list of products to purchase, single product page detailing price variation and add to cart function. Cart page that clearly lists all the details about the product and checkout button. Two payment method :Cash on delivery and Paypal. And after successfull payment, a order status page listing customer details and order status such as "preparing", "on the way" or "delivered". Finally, an Admin panel for updating the customer order status and delete or add new product in the store.
